## Description
Laboratory documentation system.

## Features
- **Feature 1:** Document your laboratory work easier and faster.
- **Feature 2:** Save all the details about your reagents, media, and equipment.
- **Feature 3:** Save all samples submitted by your clients.
- **Feature 4:** Keep track of tested samples and its release date.

### Why These Features?
I currently work in a Microbiological Laboratory. Our current system is paper based, and I believe a digital system could make documentation practices more efficient and safer. 


## API Notes
I have created my own API on the backend. I have added some data for samples, media, clients, types of testing. All these data is fake and it does not represent any real client or samples.
